üöó Driver Fatigue and Distraction Detection System
An affordable AI-powered driver fatigue and distraction detection system designed to improve road safety in Sri Lanka.
This project uses computer vision techniques to monitor driver behavior, identify signs of fatigue or distraction, and provide timely alerts to help prevent accidents.

üõë Problem Statement
Driver fatigue and distraction are major contributors to road accidents in Sri Lanka and around the world.
Existing detection systems are often too expensive or unavailable in many regions.
This project aims to develop a cost-effective, reliable, and easy-to-integrate solution to address this issue.

‚ú® Features
Real-time detection of driver fatigue (e.g., yawning, slow blinking).
Identification of driver distraction (e.g., looking away from the road).
Low-cost design to be practical for drivers in developing regions.
Visual and/or audible alert system when signs of fatigue/distraction are detected.
User feedback analysis for continuous improvement.
Lightweight and easy to integrate with existing vehicles.
